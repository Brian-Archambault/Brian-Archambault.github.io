  Above is a link to my github repository for the Eyes exercise I completed during the Full stack development with MERN course with mit. It's a simple program where the eyes track where the mouse is all around and look like they are staring at you. 
  A basic html/css exercise.

      This is my bus tracker also developed with the mit course. It's an adapted version that converted the code used for google maps to work with mapbox instead. It still needs a mapbox api key though which is a downside.
      The project shows the power of service based architecture and how even simple queries can provide you access to powerful tools and data.
